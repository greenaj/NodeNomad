# NomadicNode

**Node On Windows** *- it doesn't have to suck*

- Select a folder in which to unzip your binary 64 bit Windows Node binary distributions.
- Unzip NomadicNode zip package into a folder of your liking or just use the folder where you unzip your Node binaries.
- Follow instructions for setting things up.
- No installs to run, no PowerShell modules to install, no global symlinks to set, to shenanigans with the Windows Registry. No commitments.
- Have fun.

If you are using the 32 bit Node distribution on Windows, WTF are you doing with that crap?
